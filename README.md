Thor Storyline

In the other-dimensional realm of Asgard, Thor -- a god of thunder and ruler of Asgard -- and his people have spent their lives fighting the demonic creatures that constantly try to invade their home. 

The firstborn son of King Odin and goddess Gaea, Thor the god of thunder is physically the strongest of Asgardians. He is a superb hand-to-hand combatant, and is skilled in armed combat. He possesses three items which assist him in combat: battle axe Jarnbjorn, the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his signature weapon, the mystical hammer Mjolnir, which grants him the ability of flight and weather manipulation amongst his other superhuman attributes. He can also summon the elements of the storm - lightning, rain, wind, and snow.

Thor’s sworn enemies are the Destroyer Armor who's fight capabilities, invulnerability, incredible strength, and energy blasts that can actually tear apart Thor’s hammer had given Thor many decent fights over the years. The Destroyer requires a living soul to inhabit it as a pilot; but the longer that person inhabits the armor, the more corrupt they become.

Absorbing Man is one of many of Thor’s enemies. An ex-boxer armed with superhuman abilities who’s able to increase his mass while mimicking the properties of any substance he touches.

Amora is the most powerful sorceress in Asgard, driven by an unhealthy obsession to bring Thor under her power. Over the years, she used her talent for magic and manipulation to aid her evil ways to fight Thor and his people. She even hypnotized Thor’s friends into turning against him, and has often tricked others into acting as her agents.
